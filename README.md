# Facebook_Event_Detector
---

## Background and motivation
This is a simple natural language processing project in which the input will be some series of events that I mark that I'm going or interested in on Facebook. The model will process and determine if 1) a blackout Friday is happening and 2) if there already is a carpool event dedicated for it.

Blackout Friday(s) is an event in North Hollywood that is run on an infrequent bi-monthly basis. Since Caltech West Coast Swing regularly attends and hosts a carpool event, it would be nice to not have to do anything besides check that I'm going to the event and my server pops out the reaction event ( Caltech Carpool to Blackout Friday ).

The title for the event has small variantions to it (capitalizations, extra info, or a word play) such that simple string detection would not be as efficient.
